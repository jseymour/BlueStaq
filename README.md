# BlueStaq
Elevator Coding Challenge for Bluestaq



## The Hosted Code can be found here:

https://codepen.io/jakeseymour/pen/GRLEQog

## Requirements

-- Provide code that simulates an elevator.  You may use any language (recommend using java or Python).

-- Please upload your code Git Hub for a discussion during your interview with our team.

-- Additionally, document all assumptions and any features that weren't implemented.

-- Please be prepared to discuss the assumptions and features that were not implemented during your interview.

## Assumptions implemented in the code:

When a button is pushed, the elevator must go to a specific floor
 * The elevator button should light up indicating that the elevator is moving to that floor
 * When the Elevator reaches that floor it should pause
 * The elevator button should return to it's normal state after it has reached it's floor
 * The passengers should be able to get on and off whenever. 
 * We should be able to push as many buttons as we want and the elevator should go to those floors in the order that they were pressed

## Assumptions NOT implemented in the code:
* The elevator does not return to the first floor after all floors requested have been serviced
* We don't have a call for help button
* We don't have a max capacity or weight limit on the elevator to prevent the buttons from being pressed if too many people are on the elevator
* We do not have a "hold" button that keeps the door open
